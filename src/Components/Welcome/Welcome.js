                <br/><br/>
                <p> On behalf of the entire Firm, we offer a warm welcome to the 2018 DLA Piper summer associates. Our summer associates come to us from 27 different law schools and are resident in 18 of the Firm's U.S. offices. As you may note once you review this class's credentials, the quality of our hires continues to rise - we are again impressed with the educational and work-related accomplishments of this year's summer associate class.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Our summer class is a foundation for the Firm's future. We are confident that the great diversity in backgrounds, talents, and interests will be a long term strength of the 2018 summer class, and will serve the Firm well as we take on tomorrow's challenges.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Please take the time to review this directory and make the effort to meet as many members of our summer class as you can. We want each of them to feel welcome, and we want to offer each the opportunities to learn as much as possible about the people and practices that make DLA Piper a special place to practice law.</p>
